-- 004_backfill_digit_free_account_numbers.sql
-- Idempotent. Safe to run any number of times.
--
-- HISTORY: this migration used to normalize every digit-bearing
-- account_number into a letters-only `MV`+8 value. The site has since
-- switched to 10-DIGIT NUMERIC-ONLY account numbers (register Edge
-- Function, commit "fix: generate 10-digit numeric-only account numbers
-- on signup"), so that backfill would now renumber — and break — every
-- live account. It has been neutralized.
--
-- What remains: fill in a numeric account_number ONLY for profiles that
-- have none (NULL or empty). Existing account numbers are never touched.
